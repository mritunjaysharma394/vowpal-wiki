All <a href="https://github.com/JohnLangford/vowpal_wabbit/tags">tagged versions</a> can be downloaded from github.  We try to have zero bugs, so a <a href="https://github.com/JohnLangford/vowpal_wabbit">checkout from the master branch</a> is almost always sane and often preferred. Detailed instructions for installing on various operating systems can be found in the [README](https://github.com/JohnLangford/vowpal_wabbit/blob/master/README.md).

## Other options

If you're running Linux on Intel or AMD (IA64/amd64) you may find some recent precompiled binaries at <a href="http://finance.yendor.com/ML/VW/Binaries/">http://finance.yendor.com/ML/VW/Binaries/</a> these binaries are statically-linked (including all required libraries) so they should work on any Linux distribution.

Mac OS-X on may have a (hopefully recent) precompiled binary in homebrew.  Try `brew install vowpal-wabbit`

## Windows

We provide precompiled binaries for Windows packaged as MSI installer downloadable from <a href="https://github.com/eisber/vowpal_wabbit/releases">here</a>.
