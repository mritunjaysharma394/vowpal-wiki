### Here are some examples of using vowpal-wabbit

 - [[RCV1 example]].  Here we use online gradient descent on TFIDF transformed features while taking advantage of a cache file.
 - [[Malicious URL example]].  A sequential binary classification problem with temporally correlated data.
 - VW has a test suite.  `less +/^__DATA test/RunTests` provides many little examples with input data-sets and expected reference outputs.
 - [[Matrix factorization example]]
 - Multi Class Examples
    - [[One Against All (oaa) multi class example]]
    - [[Cost Sensitive One Against All (csoaa) multi class example]]
    - [[Error Correcting Tournament (ect) multi class example]]
 - [[Predicting probabilities]] (for both binary and multi-class classification)
 - [[Weighted All Pairs (wap) multi class example]]
 - [[Truncated gradient descent example]]
 - [[Logged Contextual Bandit Example]]
 - [[daemon example]] - how to run vw in daemon mode and get predictions
